  This is a Client`s part of client-server application using Netty, javafx.

  The application has a file repository. Users can receive a list of files, their description and
      download the selected file. The user can upload his files to the repository.

  The test files are located in the /FileRepositoryServer/files directory (FileRepositoryServer project).
  Downloaded files will be placed to the /FileTarget directory from the root of client`s computer (can be
      changed in config/AnnotationConfigInterface.java).
  Uploaded files must be placed in the /FileSource directory from the root of client`s computer (can be
        changed in config/AnnotationConfigInterface.java).
  Client`s part is located on the same computer as the Server`s part now (can be changed in
      config/AnnotationConfigInterface.java).
